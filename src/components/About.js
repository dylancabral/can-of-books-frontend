        <h3>Dylan Cabral</h3>
        <p>Hello, My name is Dylan and I am a software developer, I have a background in aerospace production and sales, I have always been a problem solver, and when I learned that at every level of software development you are solving problems, and working in teams to make things smooth I knew it was for me. I decided to learn full stack software development so that I could be hands on in whatever step of the process I needed to be to ensure my team feels supported, I hope to use these skills to improve processes and morale within a team of hard working people. I think sales and working in production for so long gives me a high level of retention towards a positive attitude and my people skills really shine in every environment I put myself in.</p>
        <h3>Devon Terry</h3>
        <p>Hello, My name is Devon Terry and I'm a Software Developer. I spent 10 years is the US navy reserves. I decided to peruse my passion in tech, after stumbling across the Vettec program, and I'm excited to start this new journey. I want to make a positive impact in the world, and use my skills to be a humanitarian. </p>
        <h3>Martin Hansen</h3>
        <p>Hello, my name is Martin Hansen. I am interested in a role as a full-stack developer; throughout my childhood, I have been praised for my knack for technology and my ability to understand and solve problems. As I grew up, I was humbled by others who were much more knowledgeable about computer science than me. I looked up to these individuals and was inspired to expand my knowledge of computers. I've been learning and developing my understanding ever since. I am currently working in JavaScript, developing full-stack applications in REACT. </p>
